# Spring Local 2022 by LOCLO
LOCLO is a local small business brand, focusing on providing quality goods while making a minimal impact on the environment.

## About the Project
The LOCLO Spring Local 2022 homepage was designed for a fictional client who is a one-woman entrepreneur. The project goal is to make a responsive, mobile‚Äêfriendly homepage based on a User Experience website project designed by yours truly (Jessica Lee).

The challenge for this project was translating a previous version I made using only HTML and CSS. I integrated what I learned since the first iteration of the Spring Local 2022 project by adding PHP and SASS. 

I translated the project to PHP for scability if I were to design and develop other pages to build a full site. Building on the scability note, SASS was added to minify the stylesheet while improving efficiency and consistency for the development of future site pages.

## Next Steps
There's always room for improvement! The next iteration of the LOCLO website is to integrate more functional components to demonstrate what the site can offer for an online small business store. A couple of examples include a search function, contact form, and a signup and login feature.
